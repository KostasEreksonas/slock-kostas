# Custom slock build
In this repository I will store my custom slock suckless software build. This is a part of my journey trying to migrate to suckless software as much as I could.

# Applied patches
In this section I will list patches that I've applied to my custom `slock` build:
* Foreground and background - blurs the background and puts dwm logo in the front.
* Capscolor - puts a color on dwm logo that indicates if Caps Lock is pressed or not.
