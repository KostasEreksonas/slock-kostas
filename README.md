# Custom slock build
In this repository I will store my custom slock suckless software build. This is a part of my journey trying to migrate to suckless software as much as I could.

# Applied patches
In this section I will list patches that I've applied to my custom `slock` build:
* [Foreground and background](../main/patches/slock-foreground-and-background-20210611-35633d4.diff) - blurs the background and puts dwm logo in the front.
* [Capscolor](../main/patches/slock-capscolor-20170106-2d2a21a.diff) - puts a color on dwm logo that indicates if Caps Lock is pressed or not.
